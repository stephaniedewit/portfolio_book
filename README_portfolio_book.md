This Gitbook was built from user yihui's bookdown-minimal repository: https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal. The 'bookdown-minimal.Rproj' project must be opened to render this Gitbook via the 'Build' panel --> 'Build book' or with 'bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'all')' .

The Gitbook consists of RMarkdown files with portfolio assignments that show the skills I gained during the _Data Sciences for Biology_ minor at Hogeschool Utrecht, The Netherlands. This Gitbook portfolio is my final product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.
