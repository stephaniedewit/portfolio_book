**Author**: Stephanie de Wit

**Date**: June 2022

**GitHub Pages created with this Gitbook**:
<https://stephaniedewit.github.io/>

This Gitbook was built with the CRAN R package {bookdown}, based on a
minimal example in GitHub user yihui’s [bookdown-minimal
repository](https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal).

The Gitbook consists of RMarkdown files with portfolio assignments that
show the skills I gained during the *Data Sciences for Biology* minor at
Hogeschool Utrecht, The Netherlands. This Gitbook is linked to a GitHub
Pages website, which is my final product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.

## Build Gitbook

The ‘portfolio_book.Rproj’ project must be opened to render this Gitbook
via the ‘Build’ panel –\> ‘Build book’ or with
‘bookdown::render_book(’index.Rmd’, ‘all’)’

NOTE BEFORE BUILDING: this Gitbook uses the {xcms} package, installed by
`BiocManager::install("xcms")`, which requires **R version 4.2 and
RTools version 4.2**. Open every assignment RMarkdown and install the
missing required packages (they will be suggested by a pop up at the top
of the Rmarkdown).
