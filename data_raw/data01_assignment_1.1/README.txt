The available information about the dataset:

Executive researcher: Sergio Reijnder.

Date of experiment: 30-11-2020.

Missing values: RawData for naphtalene vials 3a t/m 3e.

"The data for this portfolio exercise (CE.LIG.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx) was kindly supplied by J. Louter (INT/ILC) and was derived from an experiment in which adult C.elegans nematodes were exposed to varying concentrations of different compounds. The variables RawData (the outcome - number of offspring counted as an integer value, after incubation time), compName (the generic name of the compound/chemical), the compConcentration (the concentration of the compound), and the expType are the most important variables in this dataset."
