  abstract = {The historical development and improvement of the Langendorff isolated perfused heart is traced with particular emphasis on its use for recording coronary vascular responses to drugs. A range of coronary vasoactive drugs are examined on a modified sensitive preparation. These drugs—catecholamines, 5-HT, histamine, acetylcholine, bradykinin, vasopressin, angiotensin, papaverine, sodium nitrite, and aminophylline—exhibited classical responses that compare favorably with those reported in the literature and with the in vivo responses. The actions of these drugs are reviewed and the advantages and limitations of the preparation as a teaching and research model are discussed.},

  abstract = {Convergent evolution provides insights into the selective drivers underlying evolutionary change. Snake venoms, with a direct genetic basis and clearly defined functional phenotype, provide a model system for exploring the repeated evolution of adaptations. While snakes use venom primarily for predation, and venom composition often reflects diet specificity, three lineages of cobras have independently evolved the ability to spit venom at adversaries. Using gene, protein and functional analyses, we show that the three spitting lineages possess venoms characterized by an upregulation of PLA2 toxins, which potentiate the action of pre-existing venom cytotoxins to activate mammalian sensory neurons and cause enhanced pain. These repeated independent changes provide a fascinating example of convergent evolution across multiple phenotypic levels driven by selection for defense.},

  abstract = {Dose-response analysis can be carried out using multi-purpose commercial statistical software, but except for a few special cases the analysis easily becomes cumbersome as relevant, non-standard output requires manual programming. The extension package drc for the statistical environment R provides a flexible and versatile infrastructure for dose-response analyses in general. The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},
